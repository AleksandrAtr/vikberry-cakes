### **Website colour palette**
The colour scheme inspiration comes from researching famous desert brands such as Baskin and Robins, Friers, and Lindt. 

![site on different devices](assets/images/readme/colour-pallete.png)

### **Typography**
For the website design, several fonts are used:
All Headings are set to "Playfair Display" Google font, a part of the serif family that uses strokes at the edges of the letters creating a sense of elegance and formality.
All links and buttons are set to "Roboto", part of the sons-serif family. The font was chosen following research on the most readable font family for buttons and labels.
All paragraph text uses Lato Google font, a part of the sans-serif family that provides a clean, modern look.

#### **Bugs section**
During the website development, there were numerous bugs found and fixed. These were:

- The footer social media icons had an unexpected list view and wrong location. (it should have been to the right of the viewport, not in the middle) <br>

Website development: <br>
During the project development, references were made to various online learning resources to get inspiration for the design and problems solving.  

- The HTML and CSS basics learn from the Code Institute education portal - https://learn.codeinstitute.net/dashboard
- Items alignment in elements - https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/center.en.html
http://jsfiddle.net/a3nyexqg/
- Object alignments and background-size - https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/10/object-fit-background-size-css/
- The inspiration and principle understanding of the problems encountered during development was taken from the StackOverflow website. One of the problems encountered during the development was using multiple git accounts from the same computer - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3860112/multiple-github-accounts-on-the-same-computer


The project has been developed using VS Code, Git and GitHub. A new GitHub account has been created for the Code Institute course, and all except one commit for the project have been done using the same Git account. However, on the 25th of June, I made a commit from my other GitHub account ALATR1 which was set on my personal computer, and I forgot to switch it to the new one. The committed file was just a blank project CSS file.

Thank you to my mentor Aleksei Konovalov for sharing his knowledge and support throughout the project. 

Thank you to my wife Margarita Komarova for her support and the feedback on the visual representation of the website.
