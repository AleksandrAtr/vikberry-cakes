All Headings are set to "Playfair Display" Google font, a part of the serif family that uses strokes at the edges of the letters creating a sense of elegance and formality.
All links and buttons are set to "Roboto", part of the sons-serif family. The font was chosen following research on the most readable font family for buttons and labels.
